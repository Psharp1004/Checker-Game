# Checker-Game
CS2ME3 Project

This is an american checker board-game with GUI written in Java with Swing.

## Tools
Eclipse IDE for Java Developers

## Instruction
Run the game with Final2_checkers.jar

Standard: set up the board for a fresh game with yellow on the top and red on the bottom.

Custom: initiate the process of manually setting up the board piece by piece. Click on the four colored corners to change colour of the pieces that will be placed next. Each colour cannot exceed 12 pieces. 

Quit: exit the program. There is a confirmation window for this action.

Start: start a game (either standard or custom).

Save: save the current state of a game. There can be only 1 save.

Load: load the last saved game. 

Clear: clear the board (either standard or custom). Cannot be used once a game is started.

AI's colour: pick a color for AI (either red or yellow) for a game against AI. If a color is picked, AI will take control of that color for either standard or custom game. If "No" is picked, game will be played by two players instead.

## Things To Be Done
1. Count down timer (it is only a place holder at the moment).
2. Quit should only quit the current game instead of the program.
3. Save to and load from multiple files.

## Note
Please refer to cs2me3 a3.pdf for detailed design/specification documentation(MID & MIS).
